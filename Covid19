# PythonPrepAssignment
# Task : Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;

# Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :

# Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

# Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

# Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

# Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky # # group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).


age = input("Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? 'Only Yes or No'  :").lower()
if age=="yes":
